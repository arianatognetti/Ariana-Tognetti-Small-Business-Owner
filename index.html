        <p class="lead mb-4">I am a student doing a project for school at the University of California in Riverside, which is about one hour away from my home. This project is for my Introduction to Computers class which I think I am actually doing decently in.  I have a chapter quiz I need to also do today too.  Somehow I am supposed to put in five hundred words into this biography.  So I am just putting in a bunch of words strung into sentences until I reach five hundred words. I can start talking about random hobbies I have done at least over the last nine years.  I like to do soccer and I understand soccer from many different fields of perspective.  I play multiple positions on the field as well as run the game as a referee.  I have not been able to obtain a coaches perspective yet.  As a hobby I like to sing and dance as well as do arts and crafts such as embroidery and drawing.  I started doing embroidery during the 2020 coronavirus pandemic that started March thirteenth.  I have done several projects since then such as make little masks, created anime characters, cars, and comic strip characters such as Calvin and Hobbs.  I had slowly progressed until I was able to make patches for Halloween costumes from an anime called Skip Beat!  I am going through a medical journey in which I donâ€™t know the results.  I have been undergoing this journey for several years already and we are looking forward to the results.  I am barely hitting two hundred sixty six words.  That leaves two hundred twenty-two more words including this sentence of course.  Go well I mean I'm just making my workout is that supposed to be a 500 words but I mean or even a sentence is that real I can't even imagine what's really not really more I just want to meet my photo I'm just making crap up oh whoops awesome having my sister do my homework for me she's sitting there across the table for me just talking and she has no idea that I have turned on my voice to text speech to write whatever she said and I just want to say it was going to keep whatever she says in any order and it comes out in because I think it's funny Gisela Cano to be determined.  How many more to go underground well that's when I get to my gallery. Well I mean it's just my voice to text is on and she saying that's not me so that means I'm probably making a burger right now.  Oii Evans Nails on how you take a quiz right now Eminem sister is it still going I don't know is it still on voice to text well he actually take this as a great I hope you actually except this is that this point we're just doing this for the lulz balls of word cuz I even count hold on all the word for Google app.  <br><br>
